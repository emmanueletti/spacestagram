A React app that displays images from NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day.
The images start from the beginning of 2022 and increases with each passing day.

## TODO Features

- User can see a loading screen while they wait for the data from NASA's API
- Users can like and unlike an image

- Users can get a quote for a framed fine art print of each image

## Dependencies

- NASA APOD API
- Prodogi API

## Ways to make the app better

- An order form where users can input thier information and (pretend) put in a order for a print
- ability for users to fine tune the quote with options from Prodigi, such as:
  - shipping speed
  - frame color
  - image print size
